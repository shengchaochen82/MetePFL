This repository was created for the source code of the article: Prompt Federated Learning for Weather Forecasting: Toward Foundation Models on Meteorological Data. 

We apologize for the inconvenience of understanding that this repository is perhaps a little unorganized, and we will continue to improve it as the project involves too many elements.

Here are some guidelines

Section 3. SPL in Our Paper: 
base_module/pretrain_trans.py/[Novel_Prompting]

Section 4. Optimization in Our Paper.
GraphGenerator.py, aggregator.py


If you have any questions about understanding the code, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Our paper will be open soon, once the blind review is over.
